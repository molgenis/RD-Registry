Inversion Mutation Abnormality	A structural change in genomic DNA where the 5' to 3' order of a nucleotide sequence is completely reversed to the 3' to 5' order relative to its adjacent sequences. This inversion is termed either pericentric, if it includes the centromere of a chromosome, or pancentric, if it excludes the centromere. An inversion mutation abnormality may be heritable or occur somatically.	NCIT	ncit:C45589	http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#C45589
Restriction Site Polymorphism	An inherited change of a single base in a DNA sequence from an organism that changes the specific pattern of bases recognized and hydrolyzed by a restriction endonuclease enzyme. Restriction site polymorphisms can either create or abolish recognition sites for restriction enzymes.	NCIT	ncit:C45679	http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#C45679
Tandem Repeat Variation	An inherited polymorphism in eukaryotic DNA that results from variations in the number of tandem repeat nucleotide sequences, which are end-to-end adjacent copies of a short (2 to 60 nucleotides) DNA sequence located between two restriction endonuclease recognition sites. These are referred to as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), and the number of alleles at these loci can vary from 2 to more than 20. VNTRs provide important genetic information that is used to identify an individual via the DNA fingerprinting technique.	NCIT	ncit:C45680	http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#C45680

In the context of tumor suppressor genes, where a single copy is sufficient for functionality, loss of function for the second allele is associated with tumorigenesis.
