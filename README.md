# RD patient registry in MOLGENIS app

Rare Disease (RD) patient registries are spread across Europe. The EU set out to make it possible for all European Reference Networks (ERNs) to develop RD registries to provide researchers, healthcare providers, patients and policy-makers with a consistent instrument to improve knowledge, diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. This work is part of the [3rd Health Programme Work Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/pj-01-2019).

[MOLGENIS](https://www.molgenis.org) is a tool to make RD registries. For 4 ERNs we started working on implementing their needs to make a ERN specific RD registry.

ERN involved are:
* [Genturis](https://www.genturis.eu/l=eng/Home.html)
* [SKIN](https://ern-skin.eu)
* [ITHACA](https://ern-ithaca.eu)
* [CRANIO](https://ern-cranio.eu)

DISCLAIMER: work in progress!! 
## Getting Started

This repository should make it possible for people to set-up their own RD registry. Keep in mind there are several building blocks to choose from. And that if specific needs are not represented in the given building blocks the MOLGENIS app is customizable. So it is possible to add self-generated blocks that are needed for your own registry. For more information go to our [gitbook](https://molgenis.gitbook.io/molgenis/).

Step 1: Collect input on registry (what needs to be registered).
Step 2: Look at building blocks and take parts that are needed for registry
Step 3: If elements are NOT present, make your own.

### Building Blocks
The building blocks are focussed around patient information. So person information is embedded in patient/subject information.

Building blocks:
* [Common data elements (JRC)]()
* [Other controlled Vocabularies (available at [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org))]()
* [ERN specific elements (provided by ERNs that are involved in this project)]()

### Feedback
Feedback on our repository or how to improve our model is more than welcome. Please use [github issues](https://github.com/molgenis/RD-Registry/issues) to provide feedback on specific element.
