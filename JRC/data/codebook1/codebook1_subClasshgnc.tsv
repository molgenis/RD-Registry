gene with protein product	protein_coding_gene	SO	SO:0001217	A gene that codes for an RNA that can be translated into a protein.
RNA, transfer	tRNA	SO	SO:0000253	"Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides in length. Their secondary structure includes four short double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. Transfer RNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNA's corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). Transfer RNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position."
pseudogene	pseudogene	SO	SO:0000336	"A sequence that closely resembles a known functional gene, at another locus within a genome, that is non-functional as a consequence of (usually several) mutations that prevent either its transcription or translation (or both). In general, pseudogenes result from either reverse transcription of a transcript of their ""normal"" paralog (SO:0000043) (in which case the pseudogene typically lacks introns and includes a poly(A) tail) or from recombination (SO:0000044) (in which case the pseudogene is typically a tandem duplication of its ""normal"" paralog)"
RNA, small nucleolar	snoRNA	SO	SO:0000275	A snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA) is any one of a class of small RNAs that are associated with the eukaryotic nucleus as components of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins. They participate in the processing or modifications of many RNAs, mostly ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) though snoRNAs are also known to target other classes of RNA, including spliceosomal RNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs via a stretch of sequence that is complementary to a sequence in the targeted RNA.Ê
region	region	SO	SO:0000001	A sequence_feature with an extent greater than zero. A nucleotide region is composed of bases and a polypeptide region is composed of amino acids.
phenotype only	variant_phenotype	SO	SO:0001769	A quality inhering in a variant by virtue of its phenotype.
RNA, pseudogene	non_processed_pseudogene	SO	SO:0001760	A pseudogene that arose from a means other than retrotransposition. A pseudogene created via genomic duplication of a functional protein-coding parent gene followed by accumulation of deleterious mutations.
RNA, micro	miRNA	SO	SO:0000276	Small, ~22-nt, RNA molecule that is the endogenous transcript of a miRNA gene (or the product of other non coding RNA genes. Micro RNAs are produced from precursor molecules (SO:0000647) that can form local hairpin structures, which ordinarily are processed (usually via the Dicer pathway) such that a single miRNA molecule accumulates from one arm of a hairpin precursor molecule. Micro RNAs may trigger the cleavage of their target molecules or act as translational repressors
RNA, cluster	transcribed_cluster	SO	SO:0001457	A region defined by a set of transcribed sequences from the same gene or expressed pseudogene.
RNA, Cajal body-specific	scaRNA	SO	SO:0002095	A ncRNA, specific to the Cajal body, that has been demonstrated to function as a guide RNA in the site-specific synthesis of 2'-O-ribose-methylated nucleotides and pseudouridines in the RNA polymerase II-transcribed U1, U2, U4 and U5 spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs).

RNA, small nuclear	snoRNA	SO	SO:0000275	A snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA) is any one of a class of small RNAs that are associated with the eukaryotic nucleus as components of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins. They participate in the processing or modifications of many RNAs, mostly ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) though snoRNAs are also known to target other classes of RNA, including spliceosomal RNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs via a stretch of sequence that is complementary to a sequence in the targeted RNA.Ê

fragile site	Chromosome Fragile Site	NCIT	NCIT:C13375	"Heritable sensitive regions of chromosomes which show up in vitro as non-staining bands. They are associated with chromosome breakage and other aberrations. No abnormal phenotype has been definitely identified with autosomal fragile sites, but some rare autosomal recessive disorders may be due to homozygosity for fragile sites. A fragile site on the X chromosome is associated with Fragile X Syndrome. Fragile sites are designated by the letters ""fra"" followed by the designation for the specific chromosome and locus."

RNA, antisense	antisense_RNA	SO	SO:0000644	Antisense RNA is RNA that is transcribed from the coding, rather than the template, strand of DNA. It is therefore complementary to mRNA.
