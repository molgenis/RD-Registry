Cephalic index less than 76%. Alternatively, an apparently increased antero-posterior length of the head compared to width. Often due to premature closure of the sagittal suture.,Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers.

Alternatively, an apparently reduced height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the frontal view (subjective).,Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or use the Likert scale for Caucasians and African Americans [Astley and Clarren, 2000]. The height of the vermilion of the upper lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thinness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to facial expression. On profile view, a thin vermilion is less convex than usual. A thin upper lip vermilion may be associated with a smooth philtrum and an absence of the Cupid's bow, but these should be assessed separately.

Blockage of hair follicles canresult from accumulating keratin and sebum, resulting in plug formation called microcomedone, which can enlarge just beneath the surface of the skin in the pore itself. It may become visible as a closed comedone (whitehead), a firm white papule. Further enlargement leads to an open comedone (blackhead). The comedones are not themselves inflammatory. Proprionibacterium acnes can induce inflammation, leding to an inflammed, red papule.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011123	HP_0011123

Choroidal sclerosis is a term used to describe a group of genetically heterogeneous retinal dystrophies that share a common funduscopic phenotype of scalloped, well-circumscribed, and confluent chorioretinal atrophic lesions that extend beyond the macula. The term choroidal sclerosis was initially coined because of the sclerotic appearance of choroidal vessels which frequently appear white or light-yellow. However, histologic studies have demonstrated the term to be a misnomer as the principle abnormality is the loss of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the outer retina in the absence of abnormal sclerotic changes in the choroidal vasculature. Therefore, we are making choroidal sclerosis a synonym of chorioretinal atrophy.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200065	HP_0200065

AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.

HP_0001985	Hypoketotic hypoglycemia	Hypoglycemia, hypoketotic	A decreased concentration of glucose in the blood associated with a reduced concentration of ketone bodies.,Normally, decreased glucose production leads to increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones. Thus, ketones provide an indication of whether the hypoglycemia is a result of inadequate production or overutilization of glucose (which tends to be associated with low plasma ketone levels). Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism. A good starting point for evaluating hypoglycemia is to divide patients into ketotic or non-ketotic. Normal physiologic response to decreased glucose production is increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones. Ketones provide an indirect indication of whether hypoglycemia is the result of inadequate production or of over-utilization of glucose (insulin-induced over-utilization, associated with low urine or plasma ketones). The history of the relationship of the hypoglycemia to feeding is often helpful. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism.

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.

A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031678	HP_0031678

Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity.

HP_0001680	Coarctation of aorta	Narrowing of the aorta,Aortic coarctation,Narrowing of aorta,Coarctation of the aorta	Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta.,Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is often a discrete obstruction commonly located in the descending thoracic aorta. More specifically, it is usually located in the juxtaductal position immediately distal to the left-subclavian artery in a left-sided arch. The hallmark clinical finding in coarctation of the aorta is hypertension proximal to the lesion, with diminished blood pressure distal to the obstruction. Consequently, clinical diagnosis can be made by the presence of diminished lower extremity pulses, differences in timing between upper extremity central pulses (often brachial) and lower extremity central pulses (often femoral), or the presence of a supine arm-leg blood pressure gradient.

HP_0002515	Waddling gait	Waddling walk,'Waddling' gait	Weakness of the hip girdle and upper thigh muscles, for instance in myopathies, leads to an instability of the pelvis on standing and walking. If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.

Somatic mutations  occur in all body tissues throughout life and are not present in the germline from which the individual developed (The Greek word soma means body.) The majority of somatic mutations have no phenotypic effect. However, occasionally they may have functional consequences that confer a selective advantage on the cell owing to preferential growth or survival.

HP_0003422	Vertebral segmentation defect	Abnormal spinal segmentation	An abnormality related to a defect of vertebral separation during development.,The vertebral column derives from somites, transient paired segments of mesoderm that surround the neural tube in the early embryo. The formation of the vertebrar involves many processes including resegmentation of the rostral and caudal regions of adjacent somites that then fuse to form vertebral elements. Disruption of these processes can a cause of severe segmentation defects of the vetebrae. The frequency of segmentation defects of the vetebra has been estimated at 0.5 of 1000 births. The range of segmentation defects includes left-right uneven formation of somites that results in hemivertebrae or wedge vertebrae. Incomplete segmentation can result in fused segments such as block vertebrae. A failure of the process of resegmentation and migration of the sclerotomal compartment can result in a failure of midline fusion, such as butterlfy vertebrae.

HP_0004303	Abnormal muscle fiber morphology	Abnormal skeletal muscle fiber morphology,Abnormality of muscle fibers	Any abnormality of the skeletal muscle cell. Muscle fibers are subdivided into two types. Type I fibers are fatigue-resistant and rich in oxidative enzymes (they stain light with the myosin ATPase reaction), and type II fibers are fast-contracting, fatigue-prone, and rich in glycolytic enzymes (these fibers stain darkly). Normal muscle tissue has a random distribution of type I and type II fibers.,Normal human muscle is composed of many individual muscle fibers bundled together by layers of connective tissue that are arranged in a nesting-doll like fashion. The inner most structure, the single muscle fiber, is covered by a thin layer of primarily reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium is quite inconspicuous and muscle fibers appear to be in direct contact with each other. The finest capillaries, nerve twigs and lymphatic capillaries are found within the endomysium. Groups of muscle fibers are bound together by the thicker perimysium, forming structures called fascicles. Capillaries, nerve fibers and lymphatic vessels also track in the perimyseum. Bundles of fascicles are encased within the dense irregular connective tissue of the epimysium. These connective tissue layers provide mechanical protection for the muscle fibers and increase the tensile strength of the muscle. The layers are continuous with the tendon, which provides attachment to bone. Individual muscle fibers are syncytia, formed by embryonic fusion of many myoblasts or later, myosatellite cells. Each muscle fiber contains many nuclei, peripherally positioned immediately adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane. In healthy muscle only 3-5 percent of fibers contain nuclei that are located internally, within the cell, but many disease processes lead to internal nuclei. Each nucleus provides a segment of the cell with needed translated protein products.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011805	HP_0011805

In patients with HexA deficiency GM2 ganglioside accumulates inside lysosomes, which form characteristic inclusions within the cells, so called membranous cytoplasmic bodies, which are enlarged lysosomes filled with gangliosides. The highest concentration of GM2 ganglioside is found in neuronal cells, therefore, the HexA deficiency primarily affects the nervous system, causing mental and motor developmental delay in patients. Later, progressive destruction of neurons, proliferation of microglia and accumulation of complex lipids in macrophages are observed in the brain tissue.

This assessment relies on the judgment of the examiner to recognize when the difference between the expected and the observed is significant. The affected digits should be specified. The definition does not mandate the component of the increased size (bone, connective tissue, etc.), but should exclude edema. The requirement that the girth is most, or all, of the digit is intended to distinguish this from broad fingertips. This should be distinguished from Broad fingers or Broad fingertips as the girth is circumferential in macrodactyly, which is not the case for broad fingers or broad fingertips, which are increased only (or predominantly) in their lateral (A/P) width.

HP_0004904	Maturity-onset diabetes of the young	Maturity onset diabetes of the young,MODY	The term Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) was initially used for patients diagnosed with fasting hyperglycemia that could be treated without insulin for more than two years, where the initial diagnosis was made at a young age (under 25 years). Thus, MODY combines characteristics of type 1 diabetes (young age at diagnosis) and type 2 diabetes (less insulin dependence than type 1 diabetes). The term MODY is now most often used to refer to a group of monogenic diseases with these characteristics. Here, the term is used to describe hyperglycemia diagnosed at a young age with no or minor insulin dependency, no evidence of insulin resistence, and lack of evidence of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells.

Aneurysm should be distinguished from ectasia, which represents a diffuse dilation of the aorta less than 50 percent of normal aorta diameter.,Aneurysm is considered a severe (pathological) form of dilatation of a segment of a blood vessel. In clinical practice, dilatation and aneurysm are occasionally used interchangably. In this subhierarchy, we therefore use aneurysm as the primary label and list dilatation as a broad synonym.

As the patellar ossification center enlarges the expanding margins may be irregular and associated with accessory ossification centers. These are most common superolaterally and may lead to the development of a bipartite patella. The bipartite patella has cartilaginous continuity despite the appearance of osseous discontinuity. The patella expands to all cartilaginous contours during late adolescence when the epiphyseal ossification centers around the knee are also in the final stages of maturation. The only cartilage not replaced is that occupying the superior two-thirds of the articular surface (the lower one-third is covered by the fat pad). The subchondral plate does not assume the actual articular contours until the late stages of osseous maturation (after ten to twelve years). Accordingly, typical measurements such as medial and lateral angulation cannot be accurately done prior to the final stages of patellar ossification expansion and maturation (pmid:6729496).

HP_0008330	Reduced von Willebrand factor activity	Decreased von willebrand factor activity	Decreased activity of von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor mediates the adhesion of platelets to the collagen exposed on endothelial cell surfaces.,Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a key hemostatic protein, but documenting its function through laboratory tests is not always straightforward. VWF serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII (FVIII), and also facilitates platelet adhesion through its interaction with platelet GPIb on the platelet surface and through its binding to the subendothelial matrix. This interaction is driven in vivo by shear stress, which induces a conformational change in VWF that allows it to bind platelet GPIb. In vitro, however, this interaction is induced by the antibiotic ristocetin, which enables VWF and platelet GPIb to interact in the absence of shear forces. Laboratory testing of VWF utilizes ristocetin in the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity assay (VWF:RCo), which is a measure of VWF binding to platelets, or by ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA).

The results of the prothrombin time test are often expressed in terms of the International normalized ratio (INR), which is calculated as a ratio of the patient's prothrombin time (PT) to a control PT standardized for the potency of the thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the formula: INR is equal to Patient PT divided by Control PT.,The prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are the most requested tests to investigate patients with congenital or acquired coagulopathies and drug monitoring. They are defined as the time (seconds) needed to clot platelet-poor plasma upon addition of coagulation triggers, such as tissue factor in complex with phospholipids and calcium chloride (in the PT), or negatively charged phospholipids-activators and calcium chloride (in the APTT). They can hence be considered as global coagulation tests sensitive to deficiencies of many coagulation factors. In brief, they are both sensitive to factor X, V, II and fibrinogen, whereas the PT is only sensitive to factor VII deficiency and the APTT is sensitive to pre-kallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), factor XII, XI, IX and VIII deficiencies. Normal plasma in the PT clots approximately within 10-12 s upon triggering coagulation, and the normal reference range is (usually) narrow. PT results have been reported as clotting time, percentage activity, PT-ratio (patient-to-normal clotting time) and as international normalized ratio (INR).

Laryngeal atresia manifests as acute airway obstruction in the newborn immediately following clamping of the umbilical cord and is fatal without immediate airway management with a tracheotomy. Congenital laryngeal atresia is a rare anomaly that is mostly incompatible with life. Most authors claim that this malformation is related to an arrest of the sixth brachial arch at different gestational stages during normal embryologic development. Complete laryngeal atresia results in a desperate emergency during the first few moments of life, and surgical intervention must occur within 2 to 5 minutes of birth to enable respiration. The most dramatic physical finding is that the child is aphonic, with absence of any cry or gasp at birth.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025423	HP_0025423

HP_0010569	Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol	Elevated levels of cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol	Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels.,Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels occur as the result of a deficiency of the enzyme delta-7-sterol reductase, the penultimate enzyme of mammalian sterol biosynthesis that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. This enzyme removes the C(7-8) double bond introduced by the sterol delta8-delta7 isomerases. In addition, its role in drug-induced malformations is known: inhibitors of the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis such as AY9944 and BM15766 severely impair brain development. Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding for this enzyme are the molecular genetic cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003107	HP_0003107

Imperforate valve is in contrast to atretic valve with an absent atrioventricular connection. The cornerstone of the diagnosis of an imperformate valve is the identification of a thin mobile membrane between an atrium and a ventrile and the recognition of the tensor apparatus of the valve. In most cases the tensor apparatusis hypoplastic and it maynot be possible to delineate it by echocardiography.

HP_0010689	Mirror image polydactyly	Mirror image duplication of digits	A hand or foot with more than five digits that has a recognizable A/P axis of symmetry. The axis can lie within a normally formed or partially duplicated digit resembling a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe, or hallux. Alternatively, the axis can be in an interdigital space with a flanking pair of digits that resemble a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe or hallux. The most lateral digits on each side of the hand typically resemble fifth fingers/toes.,Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010442	HP_0010442

The choroid plexus should be inspected bilaterally for the presence of cysts. The size of CPCs is not of clinical relevance (pmid:16100637).,There is agreement that ultrasound characteristics of CPC, such as bilaterality, size, number, complexity, and resolution, are not related to the risk of aneuploidy. However, cysts with diameters less than 5 mm may not be linked with trisomy and large cysts in excess of 10 mm may impart a higher risk.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011425	HP_0011425

The pattern of beat in 9 + 2 motile cilia occurs in a waveform having a forward effective stroke followed by a return stroke. The direction of stroke is a function of the directional orientation of the central microtubules. In addition to moving in synchrony, individual cilia in normal cells are very plastic and move fluidly, sometimes deforming briefly upon encountering resistance and/or particles being transported over the mucosal surface. Cilia are embedded in a watery periciliary fluid of low viscosity, which facilitates the rapid beat cycle to move the more viscous overlying layer of mucus. Ciliary beat frequency ranges from approximately 8-20 Hz under normal conditions but may be accelerated by exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke.

Cofactor inactivation occurs by limited proteolysis at certain amino acid positions in FVa and in FVIIIa. These reactions are catalyzed by the serine protease activated protein C (APC) and stimulated by the APC cofactor protein S. Functional defects of the protein C pathway determine a plasma phenotype known as APC resistance, which is a prevalent and important risk factor for venous thrombosis.

Intramembranous ossification refers to the direct replacement of primitive mesenchyme with bone, and is responsible for bones such as the calvarium (e.g., frontals, parietals, interparietal) and the clavicula. In endochondral ossification, the mesenchyme differentiates into a cartilaginous intermediate, which serves as a template (anlange) that is subsequently removed and replaced by bone. Most bones are formed via endochondral ossification, including those at the base of the skull, the vertebral column, pectoral and pelvic regions and long bones of the extremities. A reduction in the amount of mineralized bone compared with that expected for a given developmental age. In clinicakl parlance, reduced ossification and delayed ossification are often used synonymously, but in principle a bone delayed ossification in a child can display normal ossification at a later developmental stage. The HPO will therefore treat poor, reduced, and decreased officiation as synonymous, and delayed ossification as a specific kind of reduced ossification.

An individual cell's decision to inactivate either the paternal or maternal X is made early in development, at approximately the time of implantation, such that normally there is a roughly equal distribution of either X being active. A deviation from equality is known as skewing, with common criteria for ""skewed"" inactivation being arbitrarily defined as the observation of inactivation of the same allele in 75% or 80% of cells (and very skewed inactivation resulting in 90% or 95% of cells with the same allele inactive). For some X-linked diseases there is strong selection in the heterozygous carrier in favor of cells bearing the mutation on the silenced inactive X, and thus, assessment of XCI skewing in female family members can be suggestive of carrier status."

Isolates which cause invasive disease are usually surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, which is a major virulence factor and the key antigen in protective protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines.,Encapsulated bacteria have been responsible for the majority of bacteremia and meningitis in children for many decades. In children aged over 3 months, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), and Haemophilus influenzae have been the predominant pathogens, with H. influenzae being a less significant problem since the introduction of vaccines against type b organisms. Disease is most common in young children less than 5 years of age and older adults aged over 65 years. In neonates and young infants, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the major cause of bacteremia and meningitis. These organisms have the shared characteristic of being surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, which is a key virulence factor because it helps the bacteria evade complement deposition and subsequent phagocytosis and killing. These polysaccharides have also been the basis for successful vaccines against all except GBS, because immune responses against the polysaccharide capsule are the primary mechanism of protection for the human host. Each species can be encapsulated by polysaccharides of different biochemical compositions, which has been used for categorization into capsular groups or serotypes.

HP_0025196	Increased total iron binding capacity	NA	An elevation in the total-iron binding capacity, which measures how much serum iron is bound if an excess of radioactive iron is added. A high TIBC corresponds to a high transferrin concentration. The latent (or free) iron binding capacity is the difference between the TIBC and the measured serum iron, corresponding to the transferrin not bound to iron, i.e., free iron binding capacity.,Iron is transported to body tissues by a protein, transferrin, in plasma. This protein has two high-affinity binding sites for iron. Determination of total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) of the plasma therefore gives a measure of transferrin, although it can also be directly determined. Virtually all plasma iron (P1) normally is bound to transferrin, and measurement of P1 is assumed to reflect the amount of transferrin iron. The expression transferrin saturation, expressed as percent [(P1/TIBC) x 100], indicates the availability of iron to tissues. As transferrin saturation increases, there is an increase in the amount of diferric transferrin, which has a greater capacity to deliver iron than does monoferric transferrin. Measurements of P1, TIBC, and transferrin saturation have served several purposes in clinical medicine. The P1 concentration and (particularly) transferrin saturation relect the adequacy of iron supply. A saturation of less than 16% indicates a deficient iron supply, whereas a saturation of over 60% as measured on more than one occasion represents excessive iron loading owing to increased iron absorption or liver disease. An increased transferrmn concentration as reflected in the TIBC indicates iron depletion if the effects of estrogen and pregnancyare excluded. Other characteristic changes inboth P1 and TIBC are useful in the differential diagnosis of various diseases, for example, the decrease in transferrin saturations associated with a decreased transferrin concentration in inflammatory states.

HP_0012817	Noncompaction cardiomyopathy	Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium,Spongiform cardiomyopathy	A type of cardiomyopathy characterized anatomically by deep trabeculations in the ventricular wall, which define recesses communicating with the main ventricular chamber.,Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is a cardiomyopathy thought to be caused by arrest of normal embryogenesis of the endocardium and myocardium. This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development, the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses, or sinusoids, occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life, proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected, but biventricular noncompaction has been reported, with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle, several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction [pmid:15210614].

However, in conditions that produce electrical uncoupling, these M cells have significant effects on repolarisation producing prolonged rounded ST-T waves or U waves. The finding of U wave inversion on an ECG at rest or baseline is a non-specific finding. It is significant when observed post exercise, being originally described in early 1940s.

HP_0020111	Abnormal CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell proportion	NA	A deviation from the normal proportion of natural T regulatory cells (Treg) in the blood circulation. Natural Treg are characterised as expressing both the CD4 T cell co-receptor and CD25, which is a component of the IL-2 receptor. Treg are thus CD4+ CD25+. Expression of the nuclear transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) is the defining property which determines natural Treg development and function.,Identification of Treg cells remains problematic, because accumulating evidence suggests that all the presently-used Treg markers (CD25, CTLA-4, GITR, LAG-3, CD127 and Foxp3) represent general T-cell activation markers, rather than being truly Treg-specific.

HP_0020114	Persistent human papillomavirus infection	NA	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small oncogenic viruses. HPV has been shown to cause a variety of lesions and malignancies, which predominantly affect the anogenital region. Low-risk, non-oncogenic HPV types are associated with anogenital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis while high-risk, oncogenic types are associated with cervical, penile, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers. Infection with anogenital HPV is usually asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously without consequences in the immunocompetent host. When disease does occur, the most common manifestation is genital warts, which may be small papules, or flat, smooth or pedunculated lesions. This resolution of HPV lesions is not generally seen in the immunosuppressed, resulting in severe, persistent and extensive manifestations of HPV disease.

HP_0025632	Reduced reactive oxygen species production in neutrophils	NA	Polymorphonuclear neutrophils comprise more than 60% ofthe circulating white blood cells in humans. They have a central role in innate immunity and they regulate adaptive immunity. In healthy individuals, circulating neutrophils are freely flowing in a resting, dormant state. Upon infection, neutrophils are the first circulating cells to arrive at the infection and inflammatory site. Phagocytosis triggers the activation program of the neutrophils, leading to the intraphagosomal release of antibacterial peptides, proteases, myeloperoxidase, and superoxide anion (O2-), which is produced via the activation of the NADPH oxidase. Superoxide anion is the initiating spark leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxylradical and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), all contributing to the death and destruction of the bacteria within the phagosome. ROS production by the phagocytes was first referred as the respiratory burst or oxidative burst due to the rapid and cyanide-insensitive increase in oxygen uptake, increase in glucose consumption, andimmediate ROS release. The enzyme system dedicated to superoxide anion production, i.e., the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a member of the NOX family of proteins also referred as NOX2, is composed of six proteins, two trans-membrane proteins (p22phox and gp91phox) that form theflavocytochrome b558, and four soluble proteins (p47phox,p67phox, and p40phox and the small G-proteins, Rac1/2).

HP_0030725	Neurenteric cyst	NA	The neurenteric cyst is a rare lesion composed of heterotopic endodermal tissue. During the third week of human embryogenesis, the neurenteric canal unites the yolk sac and the amniotic cavity as it traverses the primitive notochordal plate. Persistence of the normally transient neurenteric canal prevents appropriate separation of endoderm and notochord. This results in a variable degree of communication between neural and enteric epithelium.,Individuals diagnosed with neurenteric cysts most frequently present in the second and third decades of life with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 2:1. Moreover, in the pediatric population, 61.2 percent of patients found to have neurenteric cysts are male with a mean age of 6.4 years at presentation. The majority of adult patients with neurenteric cysts present with progressive focal pain at the level of spinal axis pathology, fluctuating myelopathic signs, or radicular symptoms.

HP_0030992	Abnormal pancreatic duct morphology	NA	Any structural anomaly of the pancreatic duct, which is the tubular structure that collects exocrine pancreatic secretions and and transports them to the duodenum.,The pancreas develops from dorsal and ventral buds that first appear in the fifth gestational week as outgrowths of the primitive foregut. By the seventh gestational week, expansion of the duodenum causes the ventral bud to rotate and pass behind the duodenum from right to left and fuse with the dorsal bud. The ventral bud forms the posterior head and uncinate process, whereas the dorsal bud forms the anterior head, body, and tail. Following this fusion, the ductal systems anastomose, a complicated process with a wide spectrum of possible outcomes. The portion of the ventral duct between the dorsal-ventral fusion and major papilla is termed the duct of Wirsung. The portion of the dorsal duct upstream to the dorsalventral fusion point is called the main pancreatic duct. The segment of the dorsal duct downstream to the dorsal-ventral fusion point is termed the duct of Santorini, or accessory pancreatic duct, which drains at the papilla minor [PMID:242655659].

HP_0030984	Abnormal serum bile acid concentration	NA	A deviation from the normal concentration of serum bile acid concentration.,There are two major bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, which are synthesised in the hepatocyte by the cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. These bile acids are secreted into the biliary canaliculi as sodium salts and conjugated with glycine, taurine, sulphate or glucuronic acid, and stored in the gall bladder until excreted into the intestinal lumen in response to a fatty meal. Enterohepatic circulation of bile salts is associated with conversion of the primary bile salts to seconday bile salts by bacerial enyzmes. The total bile pool of about 4 grams is recirculated about 5 to 10 times per day. Because serum bile salt concentration can increase by two to five times after a meal it is important that bile salts are measured while the subject is fasting.

HP_0031110	Twin-to-twin transfusion	Twin to twin transfusion syndrome	As a result of sharing a single placenta, the blood supplies of monochorionic twin fetuses can become connected, so that they share blood circulation: although each fetus uses its own portion of the placenta, the connecting blood vessels within the placenta allow blood to pass from one twin to the other.Depending on the number, type and direction of the interconnecting blood vessels (anastomoses), blood can be transferred disproportionately from one twin (the donor) to the other (the recipient). This state of transfusion causes the donor twin to have decreased blood volume, retarding the donor's development and growth. The blood volume of the recipient twin is increased, which can strain the fetus's heart and eventually lead to heart failure.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001197	HP_0001197

HP_0030666	Retinal neovascularization	Retinal neovascularisation	In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.,When traction retinal detachment involves the macula, which is responsible for reading and driving vision, severe visual loss occurs.

HP_0032082	Translamellar mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation	NA	A type of mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation in which the increase in mucoid extracellular matrix alters the arrangement of the lamellar units to varying degrees.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200146	HP_0200146
HP_0032083	Aortic elastic fiber fragmentation	NA	Loss and/or fragmentation of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta creating increasingly extended translamellar spaces, with absence of elastic fibers, and increased gaps in elastic fiber lamellae as identified on a stain for elastic fibers.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032079
HP_0032084	Aortic elastic fiber thinning	NA	A thinning out of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta that creates widening of intralamellar spaces, as identified on a stain for elastic fibers.,A healthy aorta has dense elastic fibers comprising each lamella. This term describes the elastic network as being thinned at each lamella with narrower and more frayed apart elastic fibers. This entity may be associated with an increase in extracellular matrix material in the lamellar unit. The use of an elastic stain is essential to identify this lesion.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032079
HP_0032085	Aortic elastic fiber disorganization	NA	Nonparallel arrangement/disarray of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta as identified on a stain for elastic fibers.,This rarer process is distinct from fragmentation and loss as the fibers acquire a more haphazard, poorly organized appearance, with loss of the usual parallel/concentric arrangement of elastic fibers within the lamellar unit. This finding is noticeable when at high power, and the orientation of the lamellar units parallel to the aortic lumen is lost. The use of an elastic stain is essential to identify this lesion. Disorganization of elastic fibers can be seen in conjunction with smooth muscle cell disorganization. A poorly oriented aortic specimen may appear to have disorganization and should not be confused with the real entity. This rarer entity should be commented upon, when present as it represents a more severe feature of medial degeneration, but is not essential for routine surgical pathology reporting.

HP_0032086	Aortic smooth muscle cell nuclei loss	NA	A region of the aortic media in which smooth muscle cell nuclei, involving multiple lamellae, are not clearly identifiable on an hematoxylin and eosin stain.,Smooth muscle cell nuclei loss replaces terms such as medionecrosis and smooth muscle cell necrosis that implied a loss of smooth muscle cells. While the loss of a nucleus suggests the loss of the entire cell, this is not easily appreciated on an hematoxylin and eosin stain stain. The shorter term smooth muscle cell loss was also considered by the consensus group and had many proponents, but the addition of nuclei was ultimately favored by the majority mostly as a histologic definition. Smooth muscle cell nuclei can be lost in patches or can be lost in a band-like pattern. This lesion can be noted in the absence of laminar medial collapse, described below. Both stains highlighting collagen and SMA immunohistochemistry can be used to highlight smooth muscle cell changes.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032079
HP_0032087	Aortic laminar medial collapse	NA	Architecturally, a compaction of aortic medial elastic fibers that creates thinning of the lamellar unit secondary to a band-like smooth muscle cell loss identified using a stain for elastic fibers.,Laminar medial collapse replaces the old term laminar medial necrosis and is to be used only when an elastic stain has demonstrated elastic fiber compaction. Laminar medial collapse appears as a darker band on an elastic stain as a result of a significant loss of intermixed smooth muscle cells.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032079

HP_0032094	Increased circulating surfactant protein level	Increased serum surfactant protein level	An increased concentration of a surfactant protein in the blood circulation.,Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. Increased levels of serum SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D may reflect lung damage.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010876	HP_0010876

HP_0031582	Tessier number 10 facial cleft	NA	In a Number 10 Tessier cleft there is an upper central orbital cleft with a cleft of the middle one-third of the upper eyelid, which often results in total ablepharia. The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve. The bony orbit is inferiorly displaced and widened with the lateral orbital wall shortened and laterally deviated. Similar distortion of the anterior cranial fossa is evident, being broader and more flattened on the affected side. The calvarium above the level of the cleft and the cranial base below is symmetric.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031574	HP_0031574
HP_0031581	Tessier number 9 facial cleft	NA	This is an upper lateral orbital cleft. The soft tissue deformity is in the lateral one-third of the upper eyelid, and the bony cleft is through the superolateral orbital angle. Microphthalmia is present. The superolateral bony deficiency of the orbits allows a lateral displacement of the globes. The lateral one-third of the upper eyelid and the outer canthus are distorted, thus preventing apposition to the globe. The upper eyelid does not have a true cleft. A soft tissue furrow radiates superiorly and posterisphenoid is symmetric and normal. Mild cranial base asymmetry is reflected in the pterygoid plates. The left pair is more laterally displaced from the midline. Skull vault plagiocephaly is evident with an apparent reduction in the anteroposterior dimension of the anterior cranial fossa.

HP_0031586	Tessier number 14 facial cleft	NA	This midline cranial cleft usually occurs with a midline facial cleft that completes a median craniofacial dysraphia. A broad nasal root and bifid nose are associated with orbital hypertelorism and a median frontal encephalocele. The frontal bone abnormality varies from a minor flattening to a large midline defect. There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa. The floor of the anterior cranial fossa is upslanting from its medial aspect to its lateral aspect, with a harlequin appearance on the coronal scan.

HP_0031585	Tessier number 13 facial cleft	NA	There is a paramedian frontal encephalocele and a soft tissue cleft that passes medial to an intact eyebrow. The frontal bone shows a paramedian bony cleft with an associated encephalocele. The olfactory groove, cribriform plate, and ethmoid sinus are all increased in transverse diameter, resulting in hypertelorism. The cleft extends medially to the undisturbed eyebrow to end in a short paramedian frontal widow's peak. The bony cleft begins in the region of the nasal bone and extends superiorly through the full height of the frontal bone. Posteriorly, the cleft extends through the cribriform plate and ethmoid sinus as far as the lesser wing and body of the sphenoid. The pterygoid processes are anatomically normal, but they are displaced laterally from the midline on the cleft side. There is orbital hypertelorism below and asymmetry of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa above.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031571	HP_0031571

HP_0031584	Tessier number 12 facial cleft	NA	There is a soft tissue cleft medial to the inner canthus with a cleft of the root of the eyebrow. The frontal process of the maxilla is flat and broadened, and the ethmoid labyrinth is increased in tranverse dimension, thereby producing orbital hypertelorism. The cribriform plate is of normal width. The frontal sinus is enlarged. Even though the frontal bone is flattened, bony clefts with encephalocele have not been observed. There is a lateral displacement of the inner canthus with a mild thinning, aplasia, or irregularity of the medial end of the eyebrow. There are no eyelid clefts. The soft tissue contour of the forehead is normal, with only a short downward prolongation of the paramedian frontal hairline to mark the superior extent of the soft tissue cleft. Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse. The extensive pneumatization of the sinuses on the cleft side extends backward through the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and into the sphenoid sinus. The anatomy of the sphenoid, including the pterygoid processes, is otherwise normal. The anterior and middle cranial fossae floors are both broadened on the cleft side with minor widening of the cribriform plate.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031571	HP_0031571

HP_0031579	Tessier number 7 facial cleft	NA	The temporozygomatic Number 7 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia. Soft tissue manifestations include macrostomia, malformations of the external and middle ear, temporalis muscle, variable involvement of the seventh cranial nerve (in hemifacial microsomia), and abnormalities of the preauricular hair in Treacher Collins syndrome. The skeletal cleft is through the pterygomaxillary junction, and vertical maxillary hypoplasia is present. In addition, abnormality of the mandibular ramus, coronoid, and condyle and absence of the zygomatic arch are typically present. A soft tissue furrow extends from the macrostomia laterally and superiorly across the cheek toward the preauricular hairline. The lower eyelids are intact. The anatomy of the external ear is normal, and there are no preauricular tags. Bony clefting is through the pterygomaxillary junction with hypoplasia of the alveolar process in the molar region, thereby producing a posterior open bite. The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric. There is no antegonial notching of the mandible. Marked cranial base asymmetry, with tilting and asymmetric positioning of the temporomandibular articulations, is present. The anatomy of the sphenoid is abnormal, especially on the right where there is no recognizable medial or lateral pterygoid plate.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100731	HP_0100731

HP_0031577	Tessier number 5 facial cleft	NA	The cleft of the lip is just medial to the oral commissure and extends across the cheek as a furrow. It ends as a cleft at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the lower eyelid. Microphthalmia is frequently present. The alveolar cleft is through the premolar region and extends superiorly through the orbit at the inferolateral part of the rim and floor. There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The right-sided pterygoid plates are smaller and closer to the midline. There is minimal asymmetry of the cranial base and calvarium.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031574	HP_0031574

HP_0032202	Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia	NA	Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is widely accepted as the precursor lesion of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). VSCC arises via either a human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated pathway, or more commonly, via a mechanism independent of HPV, often being linked to chronic inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (LS). Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS. As a result, dVIN is rarely identified in advance of a diagnosis of invasive malignancy, despite being the precursor lesion of the majority of VSCC.

After the closure of the foramen ovale, it does not have a specific function. In echocardiographic examinations, the eustachian valve may appear as a thin flap originating from the orifice of the IVC, or it may be totally absent.

Mature recirculating T cells that have not yet encountered their specific antigen are known as naive T cells. Mature T cell not yet exposed to antigen with the phenotype CCR7-positive, CD45RA-positive, and CD127-positive. This cell type is also described as being CD25-negative, CD62L-high and CD44-low. Human mature CD4+ T cells are functionally heterogeneous and can be divided into naive and memory/effector populations based on the expression of cell surface markers. Although the most significant differences between these two populations are functional, the leukocyte common Ag (CD45) was promoted as a potential marker of memory T cells. CD45 Ag may be found in various isoforms depending on alternative splicing of three extracellularly expressed exons. The expression of the highest molecular weight isoform, referred to as CD45RA, defines the population of CD4+ unprimed lymphocytes. Activation of naive lymphocytes through TCR engagement is followed by loss of CD45RA Ag and transition to the expression of the smallest molecular weight isoform CD45RO. These primed cells express high levels of activation Ags, acquire effector functions, and need less costimuli requirements for further activation.

HP_0032252	Granuloma	NA	A compact, organized collection of mature mononuclear phagocytes, which may be but is not necessarily accompanied by accessory features such as necrosis.,Granulomas vary considerably in their degree of complexity, physical size and organization. Not surprisingly, their classification has attracted much attention, and a numbers of schemes have been described. The cornerstone of the granulomatous response, however, is the predominant involvement of mononuclear phagocytes. As granulomas develop, tissue-resident, as well as inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes become intimately acquainted, and these cells may develop highly differentiated epithelioid cell characteristics. In many cases, elegant multinucleate populations can be seen, distinct from the syncytia formed after viral infection as evident by their extended life-span. Accumulating lymphocytes, mainly T cells, contribute to the developing microarchitecture of the granuloma, often with characteristic patterns of subset organization relative to the core of mononuclear phagocytes and to each other. B lymphocytes, plasma cells, NK cells and neutrophils may all be present, though a relative paucity of neutrophils delineates these sites of inflammation from those associated with necrosis. At its extreme, the granuloma may serve as the focus for irreversible fibrotic reactions, but, even in less dramatic cases, a substantive degree of local tissue remodelling occurs.

HP_0032011	Heterophoria	NA	Heterophorias are latent deviations that are controlled by fusion. In certain circumstances (specific visual tasks, fatigue, illness, etc.), fusion can no longer be maintained and decompensation occurs.,In contrast to heterophoria, heterotropias are manifest deviations. Some individuals may be phoric in one situation (e.g. for distance) and tropic in another (e.g. for near). The distinction between heterotropia and heterophoria is that heterotropia refers to a misalignment of the eyes when the affected individual is looking at an object while the eyes are uncovered whereas heterophoria is a misalignment that is observed only when the two eyes are no longer looking at the same object. The monocular cover-uncover test is the most important test for detecting the presence of manifest strabismus and for differentiating a heterophoria from a heterotropia.

HP_0032253	Eosinophilic granuloma	NA	A type of granuloma characterized morphologically by the predominance of Langerhans cells with characteristic grooved, folded, indented nuclei in the appropriate milieu that includes variable numbers of eosinophils and histiocytes including multinucleated forms, often appearing similar to osteoclasts or touton like giant cells, neutrophils and small lymphocytes. The concentration of the eosinophilic infiltrate varies from scattered mature cells to sheet-like masses of cells. Occasionally, areas of bone necrosis may interrupt the cellular infiltrate. The foamy cells may also be amassed in clumps, which are of no clinical significance because these clumps represent phagocytosis of lipid debris.,Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is a benign disorder that affects children and young adults, particularly males. Solitary EG accounts for the majority of  Langerhans cell histiocytosis cases, usually involving bone and less commonly the lymph nodes, lung or skin.

The destruction/expulsion of the female pronucleus at the time of fertilization by 1 or 2 spermatozoa with the former being followed by an endoreplication of the male pronucleus leading to a complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) 2. A triploid zygote (fertilization by 2 spermatozoa) leading to a partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) but can also lead to haploid and diploid clones. The diploid clone may produce a normal fetus while the haploid clone after endoreplication generates a CHM 3. A nutritional defect during the differentiation of the oocytes or the deterioration of the limited oxygen pressure during the first trimester of gestation may lead to the formation of a HM.

HP_0031954	Dystonic gait	NA	Dystonic gait disorders frequently appear bizarre, particularly because activity increases dystonic tonus and posture. The abnormal posture of the foot in dystonic gait typically involves inversion, plantar flexion and tonic extension of the big toe. In many patients complex types of walking, such as walking backwards and running are paradoxically less impaired than walking forward and may seem completely unaffected. Sensory tricks, for instance, if the affected individual rests a hand on his or her neck, may improve or even normalize dystonic gait in some patients.

HP_0031711	Asymmetric abdominal aortic aneurysm	NA	An abdominal aortic aneurysm that is not symmetric around its axis (not axisymmetric).,Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in an advanced stage of development are truly asymmetric, due to the presence of tissue surrounding the abdominal aorta and to the vertebral column located posterior to this artery segment. This makes a large AAA less fusiform and to grow apart from the centerline of the lumen, accounting for a major anterior dilation and a more flat posterior surface.

HP_0031953	Cautious gait	Senile gait	Cautious gait refers to an excessive degree of age-related changes in walking and fear of falling. The walking difficulties seem out of proportion when considering the patient's actual sensory or motor deficits. The gait appears slow, with a wider base than normal, reduced arm swing bilaterally and a slightly stooped posture. This type of gait change often occurs after the first time a patient has fallen.

HP_0031710	Compensatory head tilt to the left shoulder	NA	A tendency to tilt the head towards the left shoulder to compensate for a limitation of eye movement.,With fourth cranial nerve palsy leading to weakness of the superior oblique muscle, affected persons tilt the head away from the affected eye as both eyes are most straight in this position.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031705	HP_0031705
HP_0031952	Neurogenic claudication	NA	Lumbar spinal stenoses may induce symptoms following an individually typical latency on standing or when walking due to swelling of the cauda equina, which leads to compression. This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. The symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can be explained by an increase in lumbar lordosis and spinal canal stenosis in an upright position compared to the sitting position or if spondylolisthesis is present by a shift of the vertebrae while standing and walking. Following an individually characteristic distance, walking becomes associated with deep muscular pain and with neurological deficits, such as sensory deficits and paresis in the lower limbs, which resolve within minutes when the affected person sits or lies down. Activities performed in a flexed posture, such as cycling often cause less problems than walking. For the same reason, walking uphill may be tolerated better than walking downhill. Clinical neurological examination at rest may be entirely normal but there is usually pain on hyperextension of the lumbar spine.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288	HP_0001288

HP_0031958	Spastic paraparetic gait	NA	A type of spastic gait in which the legs are usually slightly bent at the hip and in an adducted position. The knees are extended or slightly bent and the feet are in a plantar flexion position. This posture requires circumduction of the legs during walking. The gait may appear stiff (spastic gait disorder) or stiff as well as insecure (spastic ataxic gait disorder). In spastic paraparetic gait, each leg appears to be dragged forward. If the muscle tone in the adductors is marked, the resulting gait disorder is referred to as scissor gait.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002064	HP_0002064

HP_0031957	Spastic hemiparetic gait	Wernicke-Mann gait	Spastic hemiparesis is characterized by a dominance of the tonus in the upper limb flexor muscles: the arm is held in an adducted posture and is bent and rotated inwards, the forearm is pronated and the hand and the fingers are flexed. The leg is slightly bent at the hip, the knee cannot be extended fully at the end of the stance phase and the foot is inverted and in a plantar flexed position. Gait is slow, with a wide base and asymmetrical with a shortened weight-bearing phase on the paretic side. During the swing phase, the paretic leg performs a lateral movement (circumduction) which is characteristic of this gait disorder, also termed Wernicke-Mann gait. Spastic gait problems typically worsen on attempts to walk faster.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002064	HP_0002064

ALT is found abundantly in the cytosol of the hepatocyte. ALT activity in the liver is about 3000 times that of serum activity. Thus, in the case of hepatocellular injury or death, release of ALT from damaged liver cells increases measured ALT activity in the serum. Although it is generally thought to be specific to the liver, it is also found in the kidney, and, in much smaller quantities, in heart and skeletal muscle cells.

It can be divided into 3 sections including the amino terminus of the PCT region, immature calcitonin, and calcitonin carboxyl-terminus peptide-1 (CCP-1). Procalcitonin is encoded by CALC-1 gene located on chromosome 11. Cleavage in 1 site of the primary transcript of CALC-1 gene produces pre-PCT, which further undergoes proteolytic cleavage of its signal sequence to produce PCT. The synthesized PCT then undergoes post-translational processing to produce small peptides and mature CT. PCT is a biomarker that exhibits greater specificity than other proinflammatory markers (eg, cytokines) in identifying patients with sepsis and can be used in the diagnosis of bacterial infections. The short half-life (25-30 hours in plasma) of PCT, coupled with its virtual absence in health and specificity for bacterial infections, gives it a clear advantage over the other markers of bacterial infection.

Molluscum contagiosum presents as single or multiple small white or flesh-colored papules that typically have a central umbilication. The central umbilication may be difficult to observe in young children and, instead, may bear an appearance similar to an acneiform eruption. The lesions vary in size (from 1 mm to 1 cm in diameter) and are painless, although a subset of patients report pruritus in the area of infection. On average, 11-20 papules appear on the body during the course of infection and generally remains a self-limiting disease. However, in immunosuppressed patients, molluscum contagiosum can be a severe infection with hundreds of lesions developing on the body. Extensive eruption is indicative of an advanced immunodeficiency state.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032162	HP_0032162

HP_0032179	Abnormal circulating globulin level	NA	An abnormal concentration of globulins in the blood. Albumin makes up more than half of the total protein present in serum. The remaining blood proteins except albumin and fibrinogen (which is not in serum) are referred to as globulins. The globulin fraction includes hundreds of serum proteins including carrier proteins, enzymes, complement, and immunoglobulins. Most of these are synthesized in the liver, although the immunoglobulins are synthesized by plasma cells. Globulins are divided into four groups by electrophoresis. The four fractions are alpha1, alpha2, beta and gamma, depending on their migratory pattern between the anode and the cathode.,Any increase or decrease in the globulin fraction should be evaluated by serum electrophoresis. The alpha1 fraction consists mainly of alpha1 antitrypsin, which is an acute phase reactant that goes up in acute inflammation. The alpha1 fraction is reduced in congenital alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency. The alpha2 region consists mainly of alpha2 macroglobulin and haptoglobin. The major beta globulin is transferring. Elevations can occur in severe iron deficiency.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010876	HP_0010876

HP_0032443	Past medical history	NA	In a medical encounter, the physician generally will interview the patient about his or her current problem, and may perform additional testing. The past medical history (PMH) in contrast records information about the patient's medical, personal and family history that might be relevant to the presenting illness or to provide optimal clinical management. The PMH generally includes (if relevant) other major illnesses, hospitalizations, surgeries, injuries, allergies, gynecologic and obstetric history, family history, personal history including occupational history, alcohol and drug use, etc.,This subontology of the HPO is not intended to provide all needed terms to describe the past medical history, but rather to be combined with other ontologies such as MONDO in order to capture information that is often needed to properly assess phenotypic findings related to a presenting medical problem.

HP_0032445	Pulmonary cyst	Lung cyst	A round circumscribed space within a lung that is surrounded by an epithelial or fibrous wall of variable thickness. A cyst usually has a thin and regular wall (less than 2 mm) and contains air, although some may contain fluid.,The thin wall of cystic lesions differentiates them from cavitary processes, which have thicker and irregular walls and will not be discussed in this article. On chest radiographs, findings of a cyst are often subtle, consisting of lucencies and sometimes linear opacities. An air-fluid level can improve the visibility of a cyst and may suggest infection. For the investigation of cysts, CT is substantially more sensitive than chest radiography, showing a cyst as a ringlike lucency surrounded by a thin wall.

HP_0032439	Airborn particle hypersensitivity	NA	An abnormally increased sensitivity to airborn particles. This can be diagnosed on the basis of the medical history, taking into account seasonality or a relationship to the concentration of airborn particles in the environment of the affected individual. Aerosol challenge is a gold standard of establishment of the symptom. There exist particle hypersensitivity (diesel exhaust, metals, inorganic material) vs. allergen (including pollen dander, etc) hypersensitivity. The responses are usually different and testing for allergen hypersensitivity is done in concert with serum IgE and or skin testing to the suspected allergen.,Particles can be defined as any small bits of material or droplets either inorganic or organic, viable or nonviable, that can become airborne. They can range from small molecules less than 0.001 micrometer to pollens and spores ranging between 2 and 50 micrometers and very large visible dust particles in the range of 1000 micrometers. Particles can also assume many shapes including long, fibrous varieties with a length greater than three times diameter, spheres, oddly shaped or irregularly shaped material, oblong, crescent-shaped varieties, or other peculiar shapes, such as certain pollen grains and mold spores.

HP_0032451	Oral melanotic macule	Melanotic macule of oral mucosa	Flat, distinct, discolored area of oral mucosal membrane less than 1 cm wide not associated with a change in the thickness or texture of the affected mucosal membrane. The lesions are small, solitary, well-circumscribed and often uniformly pigmented.,Melanotic macules very rarely, if ever, present larger than one centimeter in diameter. Although these are innocuous lesions, a biopsy is usually warranted for diagnosis since mucosal melanoma can mimic the appearance of a melanotic macule. Melanotic macules are caused by functional hyperactivity of the regional melanocytes ie there is increased melanin production. Histologically, this is evidenced by abundant melanin pigmentation within the basal epithelial cell layer with melanin incontinence in the superficial portions of the submucosa. Importantly, there is no increase in melanocyte number. If there is evidence of melanocytic hyperplasia, it should be diagnosed as such and the lesion would likely warrant complete surgical removal. It is possible that melanocytic hyperplasia may potentially herald the development of malignant melanoma.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100669	HP_0100669
HP_0032452	Oral melanoacanthoma	NA	Oral melanoacanthoma usually presents as an asymptomatic, ill-defined, rapidly enlarging, macular pigmentation. Although most lesions are heavily pigmented, the coloration may or may not be uniform. Any mucosal site may be affected, but buccal mucosal involvement is most common. Although typically solitary, rare patients may present with multifocal lesions.,Oral melanoacanthoma is a relatively uncommon melanocytic lesion that may cause rapid, diffuse, and dark pigmentation of a large mucosal area. However, this is an innocuous pathology that is often self-limiting and may spontaneously resolve, with or without surgical intervention.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100669	HP_0100669

HP_0032449	Abnormal dermoepidermal hemidesmosome morphology	NA	An abnormal structure or appearance of hemidesmosomes, multiprotein complexes that facilitate the stable adhesion of basal epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane.,Hemidesmosomes (HDs) are highly specialized integrin-mediated epithelial attachment structures that make cells firmly adhere to the extracellular matrix by establishing a link between the underlying basement membrane (BM) and the internal mechanical stress-resilient keratin intermediate filament (IF) network. Although HDs are defined by their ultrastructural appearance, two types of HDs, type I and II, can be distinguished on the basis of their protein components. Classical type I HDs, found in stratified and pseudostratified epithelia, for example in the epidermis, consist in five major components, namely integrin alpha6beta4, plectin isoform 1a (P1a), tetraspanin CD151, bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG)1 isoform e (BPAG1e, also called BP230) and BPAG2 (also called BP180 or type XVII collagen). Type II HDs, found in simple epithelia such as that of the intestine, consist of integrin alpha6beta4 and plectin and lack the two BP antigens.

It is expressed on the surface of cancer cells as a glycolipid and as an O-linked glycoprotein. Subsequently, CA 19-9 was also identified in the tissue and sera of patients with other gastrointestinal tumors including esophageal, gastric, biliary and pancreatic cancer. CA 19-9 is derived from an aberrant pathway during production of its normal counterpart disialyl Lewis-a which has one extra sialic acid residue attached through a 2-to-6 linkage. Disialyl Lewis-a is normally expressed on the epithelial surface of digestive organs, serves as a ligand for monocytes and macrophages, and helps in immunosurveillance. Epigenetic silencing of the gene for 2-to-6 sialyl transferase during early stages of carcinogenesis leads to abnormal synthesis and accumulation of sialyl Lewis-a (CA 19-9).

The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc.,A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups.

A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.

HP_0032517	Majocchi's granuloma	NA	Majocchi's granuloma (MG) is an inflammatory and granulomatous, dermatophytic infection characterized by a granulomatous inflammation around the hair follicle. Histopathologically, MG demonstrates a nodular perifollicular granulomatous infiltrate of lymphoid cells, macrophages, epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and neutrophils. Unlike superficial dermatophytoses, fungal hyphae and spores can be detected not only on the surface of the epidermis but also within or around the hair follicles.,Majocchi's granuloma (MG) is classified into two forms, depending on the affected individual's health situation and clinical picture. The first form is mainly observed in healthy individuals and is defined as a perifollicular, papular form induced by penetrating trauma that is mostly observed in the lower extremities. The second form is granulomatous, related to immunosuppression, seen in a nodular form, and usually appears on the upper extremities. The main cause of MG is Trichophyton rubrum, followed by T. mentagrophytes, T. violaceum, and T. tonsurans. However, several fungi, such as T. interdigitale, Microsporum canis, Nannizzia gypsea (former M. gypseum), Epidermophyton floccosum, and Aspergillus species, can also cause MG.

Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.

HP_0100274	Gustatory lacrimation	NA	Gustatory lacrimation results from an aberrant innervation of fibres from the seventh cranial nerve to the pterygopalatine ganglion which are destined originally for the submandibular ganglion. This aberrant innervation leads to uncontrollable tearing while eating or in anticipation of a meal.,The aberrant innervation leading to this phenomenon may be seen for example as a hereditary trait in some patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome in which case it may occur unilateral or bilateral, but it may also result from a secondary aberrant reinnervation following a peripheral facial palsy, in which case it is associated with uncontrollable ipsilateral tearing. In the past gustatory lacrimation was considered to be a very rare non-hereditary type of anomalous, cranial nerve-end organ innervation but rare occurences in patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome have shown, that this feature may also appear as a hereditary condition.

HP_0032537	Delayed fracture healing	NA	A delay in healing of a fracture past the expected duration.,Initially, after injury a hematoma forms and this is followed by inflammatory cells arriving at the fracture site to debride the wound. During the soft callus phase of healing a collar of bone forms at the periosteum adjacent to the fractured bone, and cells in the periosteum proliferate and differentiate into chondrocytes that form cartilage that bridges the fracture gap. During the hard callus phase, the cartilage is replaced by bone through endochondral ossification, possibly by transformation of some of the chondrocytes into osteoblasts. Finally, through remodeling, newly formed bone is restored to its pre-injured state. Depending on the site of the fracture, healing usually takes from 3 to 12 weeks in healthy adults.

There are 3 different reagents that may be used: monospecific reagents to detect either bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) or bound complement (C3) and polyspecific reagents that can simultaneously detect IgG and/or C3. In screening of RBCs for the presence of bound globulins and/or C3, many laboratories may choose to use the polyspecific reagent initially (ie, as a screen for any bound IgG and/or complement) and, if positive, subsequently use monospecific reagents to specifically distinguish what is bound to the RBC surface.

HP_0032376	Anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I antibody positivity	Anti-B2GPI positivity	Presence of antibodies against beta 2 glycoprotein I in the circulation. Beta-2 glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) is the principal target of autoantibodies in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).,Beta2GPI was identified as a primary target of autoantibodies in patients with APS. Beta2GPI is a single-chain protein containing five repeating sequences or domains. Domain V is essential for binding to anionic phospholipid membranes, whereas domain I sticks out into the extracellular space where interactions with other proteins/antibodies can take place 1.

HP_0032377	Increased urinary orosomucoid	Increased urinary alpha-1-acid glycoprotein	An increased concentration in the urine of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), also known as orosomucoid (ORM). AGP is a 41-43-kDa glycoprotein with a pI of 2.8-3.8. AGP is an acute-phase protein that has many activities including, but not limited to, acting as an acute-phase reactant and disease marker, modulating immunity, binding and carrying drugs, maintaining the barrier function of capillary, and mediating the sphingolipid metabolism.

HP_0032378	Immediate-type hypersensitivity drug reaction	NA	Hypersensitivity that is observed within 1 hr of exposures. A variety of adverse reactions can occur within minutes to hours of exposure to a drug. Some can be related to the pharmacological action of the drug (WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology type A for augmented) and usually have a low mortality. Others are not readily predictable based on the structure and pharmacological action of the drug and have a relatively high mortality risk (Type B for bizarre). The most serious form of immediate onset drug hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylaxis. Other reactions including itching,dizziness/light-headedness, nausea, chest discomfort but without any objective skin features, physical signs or physiological compromise. Skin only reactions include generalized erythema, urticaria or angioedema without any sentinel features (see below) of other organ involvement.,Hypersensitivity is broadly defined as objectively reproducible symptoms or signs, initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus at a dose tolerated by normal subjects and may be caused by immunologic (allergic) and non-immunologic mechanisms.

HP_0032379	Polymorphous light eruption	Sun allergy	The cardinal symptom is severely pruritic skin lesions. Macular, papular, papulovesicular, urticarial, multiforme- and plaque-like variants are differentiated morphologically, hence the name polymorphous. Usually one morphology dominates in a single individual (monomorphous). The skin lesions develop a few hours to several days after sun exposure. Initially, patchy erythema develops, accompanied by pruritus. Distinct lesions then develop. The upper chest, upper arms, backs of the hands, thighs, and the sides of the face are the primary localizations. The skin lesions resolve spontaneously within several days of ceasing sun exposure and do not leave behind any traces.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000992	HP_0000992
HP_0032372	Increased peripheral blast count	Elevated blast count,Increased peripheral myeloblast count	An increased count in the peripheral blood of cells that are precursors to mature circulating blood cells such as neutrophiles, monocytes, lymphocutes, and erythrocytes. Blasts are not usually found in significant numbers in the peripheral blood circulation, but can be observed in hematopoietic neoplasms such as leukemia, severe infections, and as a result of certain medications.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011893	HP_0011893
HP_0032373	Duffy blood group	NA	The Duffy blood group system is based on the presence of a glycoprotein termed Fy that is on the surface of erythrocytes and some other cells. There are two Duffy antigens named Fya and Fyb, and thus there are four Duffy phenotypes: a+b+, a+b-, a-b+,a-b-.,FY has two major codominant alleles, FYA and FYB, which result from a SNP (125G>A), and the corresponding Fya and Fyb antigens differ by a single amino acid (G42D). Individuals who are homozygous for a -33T>C SNP in the erythroid promoter region of the FYB allele have the phenotype Fy(a-b-) and do not express Duffy antigens on their RBCs.

HP_0100704	Cerebral visual impairment	Cortical visual impairment,Cortical/cerebral visual impairment,CVI,Cortical blindness	A form of loss of vision caused by damage to the visual cortex rather than a defect in the eye.,The term cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) was coined to describe damage to visual pathways and structures occurring during early perinatal development. The term cortical visual impairment was originally proposed to describe visual dysfunction in pediatric populations of non-ocular cause, and its presumed association with damage to early visual cortical areas. However, as further characterization of this condition progressed, it became evident that CVI was often associated with damage to sites beyond early visual cortex including subcortical structures, white matter pathways, as well as higher-order associative processing areas of the cortex. Thus, the word cortical has been viewed as somewhat of a misnomer, and there has been the suggestion that the term cerebral would be a more encompassing and appropriate term. Although there is still a debate in the community about the most appropriate nomenclature, the HPO will regard these terms as synonymous. It is recommended that more specific terms be used as appropriate for annotation.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505	HP_0000505

The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%.,Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708	HP_0000708

HP_0410003	Cleft maxillary alveolus	Cleft primary palate,Cleft anterior maxilla,Alveolar cleft,Cleft alveolar process of maxilla	Alveolar cleft is a tornado-shaped bone defect in the maxillary arch. Alveolar cleft occurs in response to divergence from normal development during frontonasal prominence growth, contact, and fusion. The most common alveolar portion of the cleft is located between the lateral incisor and the canine.,The palate develops from the frontonasal and maxillary prominences between 4 and 12 weeks of gestation. During gestational weeks 4 to 7, the primary palate originates from the median palatine process, which itself originated from frontonasal prominence. The lip, alveolus, and hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen all share this origin in development. During this period, disruptions of palatal development process can result in primary palate clefting. The secondary palate develops from the lateral palatine processes originating from the maxillary prominences between 7 and 12 weeks, and the hard palate posterior to incisive foramen and the soft palate are developmental products of this process. As such, disruptions during this time will result in secondary palate clefts. The alveolus is a component of the primary palate, and alveolar cleft results from mal-development of the frontonasal prominence. As such, it is most closely related to cleft lip and cleft palate. Generally, alveolar clefts are located between the lateral incisor and canine	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000202	HP_0000202

As this abnormal vascular growth seems like the native placental tissue and it does not metastasize, some authors call it just as placental hamartoma. The general incidence is approximately 0.6 percent. Giant chorioangiomas with a diameter over 5 cm are very rare, with an incidence of one in 16-50 thousand pregnancies. Small tumors do not cause any adverse outcomes and they are asymptomatic. In contrast, tumors larger than 5 cm may lead to several complications.

The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis.,Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.

Tibial torsion is the most common cause of intoeing. In a study by Mullaji et al to determine tibial torsion norms, individuals in India were found to have less tibial torsion than Caucasians but about the same amount as the Japanese population. The differences in normal tibial torsion values are expected to be caused by the different lifestyles and postures of the different populations, such as cross-legged sitting positions.

Epidermal cysts are intradermal or subcutaneous tumors, grow slowly and occur on the face, neck, back and scrotum. They usually appear at or around puberty, and as a rule an affected individual has one solitary or a few cysts.,A cyst is a cavity containing liquid, semisolid, or solid material. An epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that develops out of ectodermal tissue and consists of a thin layer of squamous epithelium. An epidermal cyst may or may not be painful or release pus, and are usually noticed as a bump on the skin. Epidermal cysts and trichilemmal cysts are clinically indistinguishable. The wall of the epidermal cyst conserves the epidermal layers, but the wall of the trichilemmal cysts, which arise from the external root sheath, shows palisading of unlayered epithelial cells. Homogeneous horny material that is further degraded to fat and cholesterol forms within both types of cysts.	HPO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025245	HP_0025245
