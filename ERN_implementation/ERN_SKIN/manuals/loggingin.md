# Logging in ERRAS Registry

To login your institute needs to be connected to the [Lifescience (LS) Login](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login.html). This means that users have a confirmed affiliation with a home organization (e.g. a university, research institution or private company) connected to LS Login services. For technical and other reasons, not all home organizations support LS login. We recommend that you try to arrange that  your home organization is added to the list of [Relying Parties](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/relying-parties/how-to-register-and-integrate-a-relying-party-to-ls-login.html) for the LS login. If this for some reason this is not possible, please contact project manager of ERRAS registry.
